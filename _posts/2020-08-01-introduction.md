Introduction
----

Exit Door Games was started with the motivation of making games that people could play together online. For now, there's only [one person][linkedin] behind the curtain. When the pandemic started, I wanted to play escape rooms online with my friends, but surprisingly there were very few available. I am hoping to document my journey and encourage others to also pursue game dev so we can all have more games to play together.<br><br>

Unlikely Success
---
I thought about making games a few times in the 2010s, but I was always discouraged by reports that made it seem unlikely I would succeed. Angry Birds was [Rovio's 52nd attempt][rovio]. Stardew Valley [took 4 years of crunch][stardew]. Grim Fandango [killed Adventure Games][grim]. The Last Express was [a commercial failure][express].<br><br>
 

What changed my mind was an app called [Rando][rando]. I was working on a photo-sharing app called [Fleck][fleck] in 2014, and there was [another company][ustwo] that made Rando. I saw it as being the closest in terms of vision for Fleck, and I developed a lot of respect for the other company because they had good design. Then they suddenly shut down the app in March, and by June they were winning a design award from Apple for [Monument Valley][valley]. For me that was a turning point that made me think I might also have the skills to make a successful game, from years of experience working on consumer apps.<br><br>

I spent the next few years reading articles, watching GDC videos and reading [The Art of Game Design][art]. Keep reading to find out more!
