Introduction
----

Exit Door Games was started with the motivation of making games that people could play together online. For now, there's only [one person][linkedin] behind the curtain. When the pandemic started, I wanted to play escape rooms online with my friends, but surprisingly there were very few available. I am hoping that if I document my journey it will encourage others to also pursue game development so we can all have more games to play together.<br><br>

The main reason I started the blog is because it was especially difficult to set up the online component of the game. I think that probably explains why there are so few multiplayer indie games. It took me several weeks of struggle and I hope I can help others overcome that barrier more easily.

Unlikely Success
---
I thought about making games a few times in the 2010s, but I was always discouraged by reports that made it seem unlikely I would succeed. Angry Birds was [Rovio's 52nd attempt][rovio]. Stardew Valley [took 4 years of crunch][stardew]. Grim Fandango [killed Adventure Games][grim]. The Last Express was [a commercial failure][express].<br><br>
 

What changed my mind was an app called Rando. I was working on a photo-sharing app called [Fleck][fleck] in 2014, and there was another company that made [Rando][rando]. I saw it as being the closest in terms of vision for Fleck, and worried it might eventually become an existential threat. I developed a lot of respect for the other company, because they had good design. Then they suddenly shut down the app in March, and by June they were winning a design award from Apple for [Monument Valley][valley]. For me that was a turning point that made me think I might also have the skills to make a successful game, from years of experience working on consumer apps.<br><br>

I spent the next few years reading articles, watching GDC videos and reading [The Art of Game Design][art]. Then on April 1st this year I started in earnest. Keep reading to find out more!
